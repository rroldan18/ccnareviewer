## 200-301 CCNA v1.1 Exam Topics


### 1.0 Network fundamentals
~~~
**1.1 Explain the role and function of network components**

1.1.a Routers

- Current models commonly used
	-> ISR 4000 Series
	-> ASR 1000 Series
- Typically used for WAN connections to route between sites and services.
- Uses protocols like EIGRP, BGP and OSPF to advertise routes.
- Routers forward traffic based on IP networks.
~~~
~~~
**1.1.b Layer 2 and Layer 3 switches**

- Current models commonly used
	-> Catalyst 9200
	-> Catalyst 9400
	-> Catalyst 9300
	-> Catalyst 9500

- L2 switches can only  switch traffic while L3 switches can switch and route traffic
- Typically used for LAN connections to switch between closets or buildings.
- Uses protocols like Rapid PVSTR + Spanning Tree & LACP.
- Port types are trunk and access mode with VLANs
- Forward traffic based on MAC addresses
~~~
~~~
1.1.c Next-generation firewalls and IPS

- Current models
	-> Firepower Series
	-> ASA series
- Next-generation firewalls provide additional security checks when compared to a legacy firewall.
Including things like Application Visibility and Control, NGIPS, Advanced Malware Protection, URL filtering , DDoS.
- As cyberattacks evolve, network security requires a deeper level of security  and visibility for the enterprise.
~~~
~~~
1.1.d Access points

- Current Models
	-> Catalyst 9100 Series
	-> 2800
	-> 3800
	-> 4800
- Provide wireless network connectivity
- Can be deployed in autonomous or lightweight mode 
- Autonomous mode APs require a Wireless LAN Controller (WCL) and are managed individually.
- Lightweight mode APs require a Wireless LAN Controller (WCL) and are centrally managed.
This mode is more commonly used in enterprise networks.
- RF environments can be dynamically changed to improved wireless coverage with centrally managed lightweight mode APs.
~~~
~~~
1.1.e Controllers (Cisco DNA Center and WLC)

- The Cisco DNA Center (DNAC) server is the network  management and command center for Cisco DNA.
- Even though DNAC can manage wired devices like routers and switches, one of its biggest benefits is wireless management.
- is a appliance that provides a graphical interface and a programming interface to design your network, add and configure devices, monitor, and troubleshoot your network.
- for enterprise
~~~
~~~
1.1.f Endpoints

- LAN devices that need network access
	->Desktops
	->Laptops
	->Tablets
	->Workstations
	->Printers
	->Phones
- Wired endpoints connect to LAN switches
- Wireless endpoints connect to access points
~~~
~~~
1.1.g Servers

- Data center devices  that need network access
	->Database
	->Hypervisors
	->File Storage
	->Email
	->Application
- Server devices are typically connected to data center switches.
~~~

### 1.2 Describe characteristics of network topology architectures

~~~
1.2.a Two-tier (Collapsed Core)

- Campus networks consist of three tiers
   -> Core
	- Default gateways
	- Layer 3 routing
   -> Distribution
	- Uplink aggregation where switch to switch links interconnect
	- layer 2 switching
	- Usually all fiber connections
   -> Access
	- where endpoint connect to the network
	- Usually all copper connections
~~~
~~~
1.2.b Three-tier

- 3 tier designs separate the core and distribution functionality onto dedicated devices.
Typically used on larger networks.

~~~
~~~
1.2.c Spine-leaf

- Spine and leaf architectures were introduced for data center solutions like Cisco ACI and Fabric Path.
- Nexus switches are typically used for the architecture.
- The keys to the design is that there is no layer 2 loops and every destination is reachable within a maximum of two routed hops
- As shown below you'll notice that unlike traditional topologies there are no connection between the 
"cores" of this architecture which are the spines.
~~~
~~~
1.2.d WAN

- Stands for "Wide Area Network"
- Routers are typically used for this architecture
- Interconnect sites over long distances
- The internet is an example of a WAN network due to how large of an area it covers.
