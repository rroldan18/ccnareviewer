##200-301 CCNA v1.1 Exam Topics

~~~
###1.0 Network fundamentals

1.1 Explain the role and function of network components

1.1.a Routers

- Current models commonly used
	-> ISR 4000 Series
	-> ASR 1000 Series
- Typically used for WAN connections to route between sites and services.
- Uses protocols like EIGRP, BGP and OSPF to advertise routes.
- Routers forward traffic based on IP networks.


1.1.b Layer 2 and Layer 3 switches

- Current models commonly used
	-> Catalyst 9200
	-> Catalyst 9400
	-> Catalyst 9300
	-> Catalyst 9500

- L2 switches can only  switch traffic while L3 switches can switch and route traffic
- Typically used for LAN connections to switch between closets or buildings.
- Uses protocols like Rapid PVSTR + Spanning Tree & LACP.
- Port types are trunk and access mode with VLANs
- Forward traffic based on MAC addresses

1.1.c Next-generation firewalls and IPS

- Current models
	-> Firepower Series
	-> ASA series
- Next-generation firewalls provide additional security checks when compared to a legacy firewall.
Including things like Application Visibility and Control, NGIPS, Advanced Malware Protection, URL filtering , DDoS.
- As cyberattacks evolve, network security requires a deeper level of security  and visibility for the enterprise.

1.1.d Access points

- Current Models
	-> Catalyst 9100 Series
	-> 2800
	-> 3800
	-> 4800
- Provide wireless network connectivity
- Can be deployed in autonomous or lightweight mode 
- Autonomous mode APs require a Wireless LAN Controller (WCL) and are managed individually.
- Lightweight mode APs require a Wireless LAN Controller (WCL) and are centrally managed.
This mode is more commonly used in enterprise networks.
- RF environments can be dynamically changed to improved wireless coverage with centrally managed lightweight mode APs.


1.1.e Controllers (Cisco DNA Center and WLC)
- The Cisco DNA Center (DNAC) server is the network  management and command
